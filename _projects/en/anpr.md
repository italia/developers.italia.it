### Intro
ANPR is a memorable project: instead of having more than 8,000 registries spread over the entire
national territory (in evey municipality), Italy will have finally a single centralised registry
which will simplify all the interactions with the Public Administration.

In the future we hope to provide more features like update your residency's address or download a
Family Status Declaration straight from the website.

This is only the beginning: did you ever asked yourself why you need to request certificates at the
registry in your municipality? Simple: at today a single centralised registry where the public
offices can access your information doesn't exists at all. With ANPR it will completely different.

At today the access to the ANPR is reserved only to the public administration and their software.
So this section is dedicated to everyone is giving support to municipalities to migrate to ANPR and
is helping us to fulfill our vision. There's a lot of work to do and the contribution of the
community is important.


### Documentation
We are working on a deep refactoring of all the documentation. For now we achived on publishing
only the current documentation in a format more easy to read and query of all the table and error
codes.

### Collaboration
We built some collaboration tools for you including an *issue tracker* and a forum dedicated to
discuss all the problems on integrating ANPR.
