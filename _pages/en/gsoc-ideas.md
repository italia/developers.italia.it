# Information for Students
First of all, welcome!

These ideas were contributed by our developers and users. They are sometimes
vague or incomplete. If you wish to submit a proposal based on these ideas, you
may wish to contact the developers and find out more about the particular
suggestion you're looking at.

Being accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive.
Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the technologies of
their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential
mentors. Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work. On the other
hand, creating a completely new idea without first consulting potential mentors
is unlikely to work out.

When writing your proposal or asking for help from the general community of
Developers Italia don't assume everyone is familiar with the ideas here.

If there is no specific contact given you can ask questions on our
[Slack](https://slack.developers.italia.it/). You can get an invite
[here](https://slack.developers.italia.it/). If you don't know who your point
of contact should be, don't be shy, there is a channel called
[#welcome](https://developersitalia.slack.com/messages/C8U3ZSM5M) just for
this!

## Open ideas

Well prepared proposals from capable students have an outstanding chance of
getting selected. We consider proposals for all skill levels ranging from
simple to crazy hard and everything in between. Introduce yourself, and we'll
help you plan one right for you.

Remember that project descriptions are just initial ideas. You must expand with
considerably more detail. Change the goals to fit your experience and
interests.

**Note for the community**.
Each project on the Ideas list should include: 
1. a project title/description
2. more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences) 
3. expected outcomes 
4. skills required/preferred 
5. possible mentors. 

And, if possible, an *easy, medium or hard* rating of each project.
