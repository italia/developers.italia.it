This page is the entry point for developers interested in integrating their
services in the national and local enabling platforms.

The resources here presented are managed in collaboration with the institutions
which administer the platforms but they are maintained by the Developers Italia
community: everyone can participate in the construction of a wealth of common
resources (SDK, documentation, tools).
