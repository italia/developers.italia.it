title: I want to work with you, how can I do it?
text: >
  Shortly we'll publish a competitive bid, following the rules of the public procurement process,
  to identify the businesses which can provide the people with the best skills to receive the role
  of *maintainer* of some of the projects of the community.
  We want to prioritise small businesses and statups which have previous experiences of
  collaborating with the Public Administration.
  We will consider the best ratio between quality and price instead of the cheapest deal because we
  think that the cost is not the only, and most important, parameter to evaluate the expertise of a
  developer.
  We are looking for a developer with a broad experience in the open source world, with experience
  of *maintainance* of one or more projects, and with a knowledge of more than one programming
  language and framework.
  To keep you up to date with the competitive bids subscribe to our
