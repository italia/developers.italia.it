title: What the mmeaning of "project's maintainer"?
text: >
  In this website for "maintaner" we mean the people in charge of write the source code, the
  documentation, and the examples of the projects, also they are in charge of interact with the
  developers's community giving them support on adopting the technology.
  Tipically the *maintaners* works in closely with the product owner of the project and with the
  technical staff of the Public Administration. For example: PagoPA, the centralised payment system
  of the Public Administration, it's project of the AgID (Agenzia per l'Italia Digitale); the
  *maintainers* which you can see in Developers Italia will help AgID and will provide support to
  the community to adopt PagoPA by thousand of people, building and maintaining the plugins for the
  most common CMS, interface libraries for Python or Ruby, and documentation of the APIs in
  technical language.
