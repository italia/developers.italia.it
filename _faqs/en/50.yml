title: Can I contribute to a project?
text: >
  Of course! Once  you have chosen the project, familiarise with it by reading the
  [documentation](https://docs.developers.italia.it/) and check the roadmap to understand what are
  the current and future goals. At that point open a thread on our
  [forum](https://forum.developers.italia.it) to get in touch with the *maintainer* and the
  community and describe to us what are your ideas.
  Once you have broken the ice you can take the reins of the project: all the open source code, the
  documentation, and the examples will be released under an Open Source license, usually the
  [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) but in some cases a different license
  will be used instead.
  To contribute just open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/italia/developers.italia.it).
