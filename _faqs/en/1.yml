title: What's the goal of this website?
text: >
  The website was created to simplify and improve the interaction between the developers and the
  Public Administration, starting from some important projects like the ANPR, the National Registry
  of the Resident Population, or the SPID, the digital management system of the public identity.
  Until now except some rare exceptions the central Public Administration limited itself on
  drawfting laws and regulations in a non-technical bureaucratic language without any tool or
  initiatives to support the developers involved in build and integrate software. Developers Italia
  wants to fill this gap starting from an handful of projects which will grow in the next months.
  Around these projects we want to build a community starting from the basics: re-writing the
  documentation in a technical language, using as a publish platform the open source project *Read
  The Docs*. By providing development environments, examples, and SDKs for the most common
  languages and frameworks.
  We'll provide a direct support via the [forum](https://forum.italia.it/), build on
  top of the open source project *Discourse* and already accessible online, instead of a helpdesk
  accessible only by phone.
