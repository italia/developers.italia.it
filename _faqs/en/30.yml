title: How do you choose a project's maintainer?
text: >
  As in every community built around an open source project the *maintainer* of the project is
  chosen based on its technical expertise, knowledge of the project, the level of partecipation in
  the community itself, and often in big projects they receive a compensation because they put
  huge effort in terms of time and resources to contribute to the project itself.
  A *maintainer* is not only a supervisor but he must be also the first in terms of quantity and
  quality of the contribution.
  Our goal is that all the projects in Developers Italia have always an active maintainer which can
  lead the community and be a constant reference to the developers.
