  I've released an open source software which can be useful to the community. Can I add it to this
  website?
text: >
  If what you have just released is supporting a project already listed on this website, i.e. you
  wrote an example of integrating SPID with WordPress, write about it on our
  [forum](https://forum.developers.italia.it) with the *maintainer* of the related project.
