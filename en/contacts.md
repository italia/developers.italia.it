Developers Italia is a project developed in collaboration between [AGID](https://www.agid.gov.it/en) and the [Digital Transformation Department](https://innovazione.gov.it/it/chi-siamo/dipartimento/) which administers it.

This website was born in order to improve and simplify the relationship between
 developers and the Public Administration, fostering the development of
modern and well integrated digital services.
Up until today, with rare exceptions, the central Public Administration was
limited to writing rules and laws, using a bureaucratic and non technical
language, without tools and initiatives aimed at adequately supporting people who want
to develop and create technological projects. Developers Italia fills this gap
proposing a technical and less bureaucratic approach.
The open source approach is a key element in Developers Italia, in order to encourage
collaboration, reuse and continuous improvement.

Further information about the project goals may be found in the [launch Medium post](https://medium.com/team-per-la-trasformazione-digitale/developers-italia-comunita-sviluppatori-servizi-pubblici-digitali-pubblica-amministrazione-57b0cfab4c00).
