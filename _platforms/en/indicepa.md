## Intro
The Index of Public Administrations (IPA) is a public database of information provided by Public Administrations and by
Public Service Managers and aimed at disclosing:
* the certified email address of the Public Service Managers and Homogeneous Organizational Areas (protocol offices)
  of Public Administrations, to facilitate the exchange of electronic documents through official channels;
* the unique code that identifies the offices of the Public Administrations needed to send electronic invoices.

The IPA therefore represents a census of Public Administrations and Public Service Managers, accessible to
anyone, containing in addition to the aforementioned data (mandatory by law) also summary information on the entity
(address, tax code, legal representative, website, social channels, classification ...), on its organizational
structure (organization chart, offices, managers, addresses, telephone, email ...) and on the services provided
(description, delivery web channel, contact email ...).

IPA information is used for example as a reference by the Ministry of Economy and Finance for
the identification of the Public Administrations required to apply the split payment mechanism
referred to in article 17-ter of the d.P.R. 26 October 1972, n. 633 (Split-payment) and to feed the database
of Public Administrations (BDAP) for the monitoring of public finance trends.
