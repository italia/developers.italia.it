## Intro

[Docs Italia](https://docs.italia.it/) is the place where public digital documents can be published and browsed. It offers to the public entities a secure and feature-complete platform for publishing documents and it offers to citizens tools for searching and browsing documents, that can be accessed from any device.

Docs Italia simplifies the publishing process: documents use a version control system as data source, encouraging collaborative editing and allowing the community to perform analysis and comparisons between different versions.

The generation tool behind Docs Italia is [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/#), which supports several markup languages among which _RestructuredText_ and _MarkDown_. We're working for improving the platform according to the needs detected during the first test year: the document converter, the publishing flow and search/browsing tools. We use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) for converting documents from the most used formats, like `.docx` and `.odt`.

A first relase of Docs Italia was completed during 2018, and more features are scheduled for the next months. he platform is based on the well known open source project [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/), which serves as a basis for secure identity management of organizations and editors.

**Roadmap**

These are the main tasks scheduled for the near future: 

* Improvement of the search engine based on **ElasticSearch** by adding the ability to filter by popularity, publisher, tags, projects.
* Finalization of the **API** for getting data and metadata of documents.
* Handling of controlled vocabularies for **tagging** contents and improvement of navigation between related documents.
* Improvement of the **frontend interface**, according to the [designs](https://invis.io/AQMX2Y2GTH2).
* Simplifcation of the onboarding process and the administration/publishing backoffice.
* Improvement of the **infrastructure** and log handling, and improvement of disaster recovery strategy.
* Whitelabel features for organizations: we want to enable organizations to customize their page and use their own domains as well as embed contents from Docs Italia in their website.
