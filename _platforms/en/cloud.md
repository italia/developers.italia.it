## Intro

The [Three-Year Plan for ICT in Public Administration](https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/en/) called for the elaboration of a national strategy for the adoption of cloud computing in the digital infrastructures of the Italian public sector. The strategy has been published on the dedicated website ([cloud.italia.it](https://cloud.italia.it)) where the documents and tools related to its implementation are presented: informative content, operating instructions and official communications, with legal advertisement value, as referred from AgID circulars.
