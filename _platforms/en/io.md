## Intro

IO changes the way public services are delivered, putting the citizen at the center of the relationship with public entities and institutions. Even today, too often, citizens have to go to a public office and untangle dozens of digital platforms to figure out how to access the services of various entities and manage related obligations to the state. 

With IO, administrations contact citizens through a single app, enabling them to manage operations related to a specific service quickly, punctually and securely from the comfort of their smartphone or tablet.
