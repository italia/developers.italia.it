## Intro

io is the app of the Italian Government that will allow all the citizens to use the national and local public services from their own smartphone in a simple, modern and secure way.
It's an Open Source project that will grow day to day, involving different entities and services.

io aims to facilitate the relationship between citizens and the Public Administration (PA) through the creation of a platform of reusable components capable of making digital services more effective and improve communication between citizens and the PA.

The components are reused by the administrations that provide digital services in order to ensure a consistent user experience as well as save on the effort required by a tout-court implementation of these transversal technologies.

The goal is to provide a simpler and more familiar way for the Public Administration to communicate with citizens, notify deeds, remember deadlines, share information and documents through an interface built on the citizen.

## Using the APIs

To begin using the API you need to register on the [IO Developer](https://developer.io.italia.it/){:target="_blank"} portal. After the registration phase, you need to click on the "sign up for the digital citizenship API" button to receive the API key you will use to authenticate API calls. You will also receive an email with further instructions, including a fake fiscal code that you can use to send a test message. For more information, please refer to the [documentation to the use of the APIs](https://developer.io.italia.it/openapi.html){:target="_blank"}

The preferences management API will allow citizens to centrally manage all the information associated with their digital citizen profile. These information makes it possible to create personalized digital services (communication channels, language preference, privacy settings, etc...).

The communication APIs provide a single channel that the Public Administration can use to send communications, notices and deadlines to the citizen. This communication system is in turn integrated with the preferences management API, to allow services to communicate with citizens on the basis of preference information.
