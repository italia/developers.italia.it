## Intro

The [Data & Analytics Framework (DAF)](https://docs.italia.it/italia/piano-triennale-ict/pianotriennale-ict-doc-en/en/bozza/doc/09_data-analytics-framework.html) is part of the activities aimed
at enhancing the national public information heritage. DAF aims to
develop and simplify the interoperability of public data between PAs,
standardize and promote the dissemination of *open data*, optimize data
analysis processes and generate knowledge. The idea is to open the world
of public administration to the benefits offered by modern platforms for
managing and analysing *big data*.

The DAF is based on a **big data platform**, composed of: a *data lake,*
a set of *data engines* and tools for data communication.

In the *data lake* personal data such as: (i) data bases that PA
generates in order to carry out its institutional mandate, in compliance
with personal data protection regulations; (ii) data generated by Public
Administration's IT systems such as logs and usage data that do not fall
under the previous definition; (iii) authorized data from the web and
social networks of potential public interest, are stored.

The *Big Data Engines* are useful for harmonizing and processing, both
in *batch* mode and *real-time*, the raw data stored in the *Data lake,*
and implementing models of *machine learning*.

Lastly, data communication tools are useful in favouring the use of data
processed by stakeholders, including through APIs that display data and
functionality to third-party applications.
