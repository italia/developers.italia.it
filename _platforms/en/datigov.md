## Intro
Transparency, reuse and participation are some of the key words that guide the process of the opening of the data and they are inherited from the free software community, which produces for years a high quality software code development model based on the principles of sharing and openness.
Our aim is to evolve the current online portal of open data to a system that provides developed tools and services shared with the community to extend the potentialities.

As with all the projects of Developers Italia, the portal of open data follows a development model based on a collaborative process  which is typical of the community of developers. The tools that we want to use to structure the development process are:

  * A development roadmap agile and public 
  * Source code open from the start
  * A public tracking system of the errors 
  * Clear documentation of the code and the API

## Documentation

Waiting for a publication of a further documentation concerning the project, in the meantime here you can find the architectural document:
