## Intro
Transparency, reuse and participation are some of the key words that guide the process of the opening of the data and they are inherited from the free software community, which produces for years a high quality software code development model based on the principles of sharing and openness.
Our aim is to evolve the current online portal of open data to a system that provides developed tools and services shared with the community to extend the potentialities.

As with all the projects of Developers Italia, the portal of open data follows a development model based on a collaborative process  which is typical of the community of developers. The tools that we want to use to structure the development process are:

  * A development roadmap agile and public
  * A public development roadmap
  * Source code open from the start
  * A public tracking system of the errors
  * Clear documentation of the code and the API

## Using API

Citizens, businesses and public administrations interested in using the metadata of the national catalog using the API can find all the information on the [page dedicated to site developers](https://www.dati.gov.it/sviluppatori){:target="_blank"}.

There is also a repository that implements a [sample Python client](https://github.com/italia/dati.gov.it-python-example){:target="_blank"} to show how to interface to the API.
