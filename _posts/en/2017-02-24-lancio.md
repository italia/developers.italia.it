Developers Italia, created in collaboration between [AgID](http://agid.gov.it) and [The Digital Transformation Team](https://teamdigitale.governo.it), is the Italian community of public services' developers, a technology platform where all the main technical projects will be hosted which provides:

 * a GitHub space for hosting source code and open-source libraries ready-made for use and integration;
 * an area based on ReadTheDocs for rewriting the documentation finally in a modern format, thought by and written for techies;
 * a newsletter and a news space, to be notified when there is a new version (rather than finding out by mistake, perhaps at the end of a project...);
 * an open forum based on Discourse, where you can freely discuss with colleagues anywhere in Italy.

We are also evaluating a sandboxed space for the APIs, to have a clear and simple reference, to test the connections to the APIs directly from browsers, and to download ready-made "client schemes".

We believe that tech initiatives will never succeed as a result of imposing laws, but they will only succeed if they become useful for citizens, are modern, and are easy to integrate for developers. As such we want to create an open environment to offer tools and documentation, to receive comments and contributions, interact with public and private sector developers, to improve the quality and simplicity.

The platform today is a shell to be filled and we need everybody's contribution. Enter in Developers Italia and help us build the foundations of the new Italian public services.
