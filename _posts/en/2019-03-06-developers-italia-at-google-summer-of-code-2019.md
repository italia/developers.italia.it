[Developers Italia](https://developers.italia.it/) has been selected as an org
adhering to the [2019 edition of the Google Summer of
Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Thanks to the **summer camp
promoted by Google**, students from all over the world will be able to
contribute to the open source projects of the Developers
Italia team supported by a group of mentors.

## Google Summer of Code, what is it about 

**Google Summer of Code** is not an internship but, instead, it is a summer
program dedicated to university students from all over the world. The program allows
admitted students to work for three months on open source projects
from one of the 206 accepted organizations, among which you can find [the
Developers Italia
community](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5088529877565440/).


Selected students will receive a **grant** and the **coaching support of
a mentor** during all the GSoC period. The objective is to enrich the open
source development skills and also to take place in the community activities.
In our case, this means **contributing with ideas** to improve the citizens'
lives!

## How to participate 


Thanks to the GSoC program, the last year two students, Lorenzo Soligo and
Rugantio Costa, could contribute to some **Developers Italia open source
projects**, working in particular on the [Data & Analytics
Framework](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/it/projects/daf.htm), the Digital
Transformation Team's project aimed at developing a portal dedicated to Italian
public open data.


If you want to participate at this year's edition of the program you can:

- find a project to work on, picking from the [proposed ideas
  list](https://developers.italia.it/en/gsoc-ideas/) on Developers Italia or
  proposing **your own development idea** (the last point of the list);
- prepare your application, also asking for help to our mentors through the
  [ Developers Italia slack channel](https://slack.developers.italia.it/);
- send your proposal to the GSoC 2019 program **before Aprile 9th 2019**.

In order to carry out a useful and successful application, we suggest you to be
proactive, propose solutions to issues, write some documentation and
in particular... show your skills!

We are waiting for your proposals,

the Developers Italia Team
