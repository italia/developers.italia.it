We released the **source code and the credentials** to access the testing
environment of the National Resident Population Register
([ANPR](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/projects/anpr.htm)). 

This is an important step for the development of the **national register**,
since it allows every developer to work independently on the ANPR integration,
even without requiring municipality credentials.

In fact, from this moment [a page](https://anpr-test.bobuild.com/request) where
to request ANPR test credentials is made available. Thanks to these
credentials and the [sharing of a test client source
code](https://github.com/italia/anpr-client-example), starting today anyone may
develop a client which interfaces with ANPR, using a **fictional test
municipality**.
 
This is a real opening which will allow to accelerate the proliferation of the
registry and the services that integrate with it on the national territory.
